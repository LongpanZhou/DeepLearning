# Deep Learning
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This repo includes all the milestone models in deep learning, featuring the implementation of each model along with a summary that highlights what makes each model unique and how it advances the field compared to previous architectures. If you wish to follow a path and build your own models from the most basic until most modern, this will hopefully be a good resources for you.

> [!NOTE]  
> As the models become more complex, training them on a personal computer may become challenging due to hardware limitations. In such cases, I strongly recommend using a computing cluster or cloud services to facilitate training.
